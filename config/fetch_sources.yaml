# PRISM Fetch Sources - CLI Metadata
# =============================================================================
#
# This file provides CLI metadata for the fetch.py script only.
# It defines available source flags, help text, and environment key hints.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - This file is loaded by fetch.py for CLI generation only.
#   - FetchRunner does NOT load this file.
#   - FetchRunner resolves sources from the database and uses the
#     Python fetcher registry (prism.fetch.registry) to instantiate fetchers.
